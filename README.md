# iACP-DPNet
Anticancer peptides (ACPs) are acknowledged for their potential in cancer therapy, attributed to their safety, low side effects, and high target specificity. However, the discovery of ACPs is slowed by the high cost and labor-intensive nature of experimental validation, resulting in a limited number of confirmed ACPs. This study tackles key challenges in ACPs prediction by constructing a novel dataset and proposing a deep learning-based predictive model named iACP-DPNet. The model utilizes the protein language model ProtBert with positional encoding to convert protein sequences into feature vectors, then applies a two-step feature selection process via LightGBM and MIC. The selected features undergo processing by a causal dilated convolution network. Feature learning is augmented with a dual-pooling layer that integrates GlobalAveragePooling and attention pooling for classification. To understand the model's decision process, we employ t-SNE for visualizing key steps and ISM for interpreting sequence regions. The model demonstrates excellent performances on our new dataset, as validated by 10-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, to assess its generalizability, we evaluated iACP-DPNet on an additional dataset, where it outperformed other current models. In conclusion, the iACP-DPNet exhibits exceptional performance and generalizability, showcasing its advanced design and effectiveness in ACPs prediction. This research provides a robust and interpretable framework for advancing research in anticancer peptide discovery.
